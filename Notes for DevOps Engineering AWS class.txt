=============================================================


Day 1:

Infrastructure as Code
    - Each AWS account max 100 buckets
        - Mgmt Console
        - CLI
        - Cloudformation (on par with Terraform)

    - automating the process of creating, updating or deleting infra
    - shell scripts
    - appl code leveraging the SDK (python, node, etc)
    - 3rd party tools
    - AWS CF
    - Automation! - same structure deployment again and again
    - Dulles airport - 50 miles in all direction is us-east-1
    - Benefits:
        - infra can be versioned and managed
        - repeatedly and reliably created and turned off and recreated
        - created as needed to test the latest version of your application

        - cost savings, creation of mult env, and creation of identical envs for multiple customers

    - DevOps?
        - auto instantiation of stacks from templates using AWS CLI, SDK, and CodePipeline
        - parameter validation to eliminate execution errors
        - chaining and nesting stacks
        - custom resources to connect systems together and to validate deployments
        - addtl features to simplify changes to infrastructure

    - structure of a CF template
        - Format Version - corresponding AWS CF template version
        - description - text string
        - Parameters - inputs into template
        - Mappings - static vars, KV pairs
        - Conditions - controls for if and when certain resources are created or updated
        - Resources - aws assets to create
        - Outputs - values of custom resources created by template (URLs, username, etc)
